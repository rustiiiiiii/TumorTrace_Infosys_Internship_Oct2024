##  Installation

To run this project, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this by executing the following command: 

```shell
pip  install  -r  requirements.txt
```

  

## Usage
  
1.  Clone  the  repository
```shell
git  clone  https://github.com/yourusername/TumorTrace.git

cd  TumorTrace
```
  

2.  Place  your  MRI  dataset  in  the  specified  directory.

3. Run  the  Jupyter  Notebook:
```shell
jupyter  notebook
```

4.  Follow  the  instructions  in  the  notebook  to  preprocess  data,  train  the  model,  and  evaluate  its  performance.

  

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

  

The  dataset  consists  of  MRI  images  labeled  as  malignant  or  benign.  The  data  was  collected  from [source/database], ensuring a diverse representation of cases.

  

The  preprocessing  steps  included:

  

 - Converting  images  to  grayscale.
   
  - Resizing  images  to  a  standard  dimension (e.g., 224x224).
   
  - Normalizing  pixel  values  to  a  range  suitable  for  neural 
   network  input.
   
  - Augmenting  the  dataset  using  techniques  such  as  rotation  and 
   flipping.

  

## Model Architecture

  

The  model  uses  a  Convolutional  Neural  Network (CNN) architecture designed to extract features from MRI images effectively. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by pooling and dense layers.
