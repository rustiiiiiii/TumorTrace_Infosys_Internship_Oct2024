#  Project Tumor Trace: MRI-Based AI for Breast Cancer Detection

  

##  Project Overview

The **Tumor Trace** project aims to develop an AI-based model for detecting breast cancer using MRI images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the goal is to provide accurate predictions to assist radiologists in early diagnosis.

##  Installation

To run this project, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this by executing the following command: 

```shell
pip  install  -r  requirements.txt
```

  

## Usage
  
1.  Clone  the  repository
```shell
git  clone  https://github.com/yourusername/TumorTrace.git

cd  TumorTrace
```
  

2.  Place  your  MRI  dataset  in  the  specified  directory.

3. Run  the  Jupyter  Notebook:
```shell
jupyter  notebook
```

4.  Follow  the  instructions  in  the  notebook  to  preprocess  data,  train  the  model,  and  evaluate  its  performance.

  

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

  

The  dataset  consists  of  MRI breast  images  labeled  as  malignant  or  benign. 

  

The  preprocessing  steps  included:

  

- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) – This feature descriptor has been used for object detection from MRI images.
  
- Sobel Operator - Operator is used to find the edges in an image by specifying regions where there is a significant change in intensity (brightness).
  
- Local Binary Pattern – This texture operator has been used on MRI images which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.
  
- MVM-LBP - Mean-Variance-Median Local Binary Pattern – Advanced texture method is used.


  

## Model Architecture

  

The  model  uses  a  Convolutional  Neural  Network (CNN) architecture designed to extract features from MRI images effectively. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by pooling and dense layers.
