Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the data underwent several cleaning steps:

Label Verification: Ensured that all labels (malignant or benign) were correctly assigned to their respective images.
Data Preparation
The images were prepared for analysis through the following preprocessing steps:

Grayscale Conversion: All images were converted to grayscale to simplify the analysis and reduce computational complexity.
Resizing: Images were resized to a standard dimension (e.g., 224x224 pixels) to maintain consistency across the dataset.
Normalization: Pixel values were normalized to a range of [0, 1] to enhance model training effectiveness and speed.
Data Augmentation: To increase the diversity of the training dataset and reduce overfitting, various augmentation techniques were applied:
Rotation: Random rotations within a specified degree range.
Flipping: Horizontal and vertical flips of images.
Zooming: Random zooming in and out of images.
These preprocessing steps ensure that the data fed into the model is clean, consistent, and representative of real-world scenarios, ultimately improving the performance and robustness of the final model.
