üìä Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data Source:

The dataset is sourced from Computers in Biology and Medicine and contains MRI images labeled as either malignant or benign. This ensures a diverse range of cases for robust training.

Preprocessing Steps:

Grayscale Conversion: All images were converted to grayscale for uniformity.

Resizing: Images were resized to a standard dimension of 224x224 pixels.

Normalization: Pixel values were normalized to a range suitable for neural network input.

Augmentation: To enhance the dataset, augmentation techniques such as rotation and flipping were applied.

Class Weights: Class weights were utilized to address imbalances in the dataset.
