## Data Collection and Preprocessing  

### Data Overview  
The dataset consists of MRI images categorized into two classes: **malignant** (indicative of cancer) and **benign** (non-cancerous). It was sourced from [source/database], ensuring diverse patient demographics and imaging conditions.  

### Preprocessing Workflow  
The following steps were implemented to prepare the dataset:  
1. **Grayscale Conversion**: Simplified image representation by converting to a single intensity channel.  
2. **Resizing**: Standardized image dimensions to **224x224 pixels** for consistency across models.  
3. **Normalization**: Scaled pixel values to the range [0, 1], optimizing the modelâ€™s performance during training.  
4. **Data Augmentation**: Enhanced the dataset using techniques like **rotation** and **horizontal flipping** to mitigate overfitting.

## Model Architecture  

The project employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for effective feature extraction from MRI images. Three architectures were analyzed:  

### **VGG16**  
- Utilized a pre-trained VGG16 model, modified for binary classification.  
- Fine-tuned to focus on distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors.  

### **ResNet18 and ResNet50**  
- Incorporated residual connections to mitigate vanishing gradient issues, enabling deeper network training.  
- These architectures provided robust performance in handling complex patterns within medical images.

## Training  

### Training Setup  
The training process was configured as follows:  
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer for efficient weight updates.  
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss, with class weights to address dataset imbalances.  
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: StepLR scheduler with a step size of 7 epochs and a gamma of 0.1.  
- **Epochs**: 50  
- **Batch Size**: 32  

Training was conducted on a GPU-enabled setup to manage the computational requirements effectively.

## Evaluation Metrics  

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:  
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions.  
- **Precision**: Focuses on minimizing false positive rates.  
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Measures the ability to correctly identify malignant cases.  
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall for a comprehensive evaluation.  
- **AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)**: Reflects the model's discrimination capability between classes.
