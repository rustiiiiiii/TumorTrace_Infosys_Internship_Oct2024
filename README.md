# Breast Cancer Tumor Detection Using ResNet50

This project is designed for detecting breast cancer tumors (either **Benign** or **Malignant**) using the **ResNet50** model. The model is trained on image data of breast cancer histopathological slides to classify tumors based on input images.

## Project Overview

This project uses the **ResNet50** deep learning model, which is a convolutional neural network architecture, to classify breast cancer tumors as either **Benign** or **Malignant**. The goal is to automate the diagnostic process to aid in early detection and reduce human error.

The Jupyter Notebook (`breast_cancer_detection.ipynb`) contains the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Training (ResNet50)
3. Model Evaluation
4. Prediction on new images

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Pillow

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn opencv-python pillow matplotlib
```

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-tumor-detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd breast-cancer-tumor-detection
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   To open the notebook, navigate to the directory where `breast_cancer_detection.ipynb` is stored and run:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook breast_cancer_detection.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

Once the notebook is opened, follow the steps in the notebook to:
1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Train the ResNet50 model on the breast cancer dataset.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
4. Use the trained model to classify new images as **Benign** or **Malignant**.

### Example:
```python
# To predict a new image
image_path = "path_to_image.jpg"
predicted_class = predict_image(image_path)
print(predicted_class)  # Outputs: 'Benign' or 'Malignant'
```

## Model Details

- **ResNet50**: A convolutional neural network with 50 layers that is pre-trained on ImageNet.
- The model is fine-tuned to detect features specific to breast cancer tumors.

### Architecture:
- The base ResNet50 model is used with transfer learning. The final layers are replaced with custom dense layers suited for binary classification (Benign/Malignant).
  
### Input:
- The input to the model is an image of a breast tissue slide, usually in `.jpg` or `.png` format.

### Output:
- The model outputs a label: **Benign** or **Malignant** based on the image input.

## Training Process

The training process involves:
1. Loading the dataset of breast cancer images.
2. Preprocessing the images (resize, normalization).
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Fine-tuning the ResNet50 model for classification.
5. Training the model with a binary cross-entropy loss function.

You can monitor the training progress through the accuracy and loss graphs that are plotted during the training phase.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated using the test dataset. The evaluation includes:
- **Accuracy**: How well the model performs on unseen data.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To show the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Classification Report**: Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how deep learning, specifically using pre-trained models like ResNet50, can help in automating the classification of breast cancer tumors. By using this approach, early detection can be achieved, potentially leading to better treatment outcomes.
