# Breast Cancer Tumor Detection Using ResNet50

This project aims to detect breast cancer tumors as either **Benign** or **Malignant** using a deep learning model based on **ResNet50** architecture. The model is trained to classify histopathological images of breast cancer tissues.

## Project Overview

This project leverages a **ResNet50** model, a convolutional neural network architecture, to classify breast cancer images as **Benign** or **Malignant**. The Jupyter notebook (`breast_cancer_detection.ipynb`) contains all the necessary steps, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on new images.

## Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- Scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn opencv-python pillow matplotlib
